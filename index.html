                <h2 class="h-secondary ">City Of Mahadev</h2>
                <p class="center">According to Hindu mythology, Varanasi was founded by Shiva, one of three principal
                    deities along with Brahma and Vishnu. During a fight between Brahma and Shiva, one of Brahma's five
                    heads was torn off by Shiva. As was the custom, the victor carried the slain adversary's head in his
                    hand and let it hang down from his hand as an act of ignominy, and a sign of his own bravery. A
                    bridle was also put into the mouth. Shiva thus dishonored Brahma's head, and kept it with him at all
                    times. When he came to the city of Varanasi in this state, the hanging head of Brahma dropped from
                    Shiva's hand and disappeared in the ground. Varanasi is therefore considered an extremely holy site.

                <p class="center">The Ganga Aarti at Varanasi’s Dashashwamedh Ghat is a sight to behold. It is an
                    excellent example of India’s old tradition of river worship packaged in such a way that it appeals
                    to a wide range of people. Pilgrims flock to the sacred Ganga to pray. When you think about
                    Varanasi, images of Ganga’s moon-shaped Ghats come to mind. The Ganga Aarti takes place on the steep
                    steps connecting the Ganga to the city, which are well-known for their sights and sounds. Every
                    evening, devotees gather in front of the Ganga, affectionately known as Ganga Maiyya or Mother
                    Ganga. They thank Ganga for nourishing them on her banks and cleansing them with her purifying
                    waters during Ganga Aarti.
